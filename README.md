# hci-exam
This repository contains the material to submit for the HCI exam.

The folder "payroll project" contains the written report for the exam project.
The folder "Langton's ant" contains the java code for the programming assignment (option #3).


--------------- Langton's ant running instructions ---------------

You must compile and execute the java files contained in the folder named "Langton's ant".
- In the 'inputs' panel you can find width, height and scheme parameters, and you can set them. Width and height represent the size of the plane (number of cells that form the matrix plane).
- In the 'commands' plane you can find controls that allow you to start and pause the simulation, and also to clear the state of the board. You can set the frame rate of the simulation too (even during the execution). With the mouse wheel it's also possible to zoom in/out the board, and dragging you can perform panning.

Therefore, has been implemented also the extra feature of multiple colors: changing the scheme field with more than two L/R chars, colors are updated as the ant moves.
